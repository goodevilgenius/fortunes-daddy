fortunes-daddy
==============

A PHP script to generate a feed similar to those generated by
http://www.quotesdaddy.com/ using the Unix fortunes program.

I originally wrote this for the
[Variety wallpaper changer](http://peterlevi.com/variety/). I modified the
source so that it could get quotes both from QuotesDaddy, and my local
fortunes-daddy installation.

However, Variety now supports a plugin system that allows developers to define
additional source for quotes. Since that is a more elegant solution, I have
created a plugin, which can be found
[here](https://gist.github.com/goodevilgenius/3878ce0f3e232e3daf5c).

Since I now have a plugin-based solution, I will no longer be developing this
program, although I don't know what else could be added to it anyhow.
